Payroll Time Card Generator

Author: Taylor Poulsen
Date: January 2021

This program takes a specifically formatted excel spreadsheet and converts
it into a csv to then be parsed and used to generate a timecard textfile. 
This text file will then be converted to base64 which will be sent to each of
the employees over email as an attachment. The base64 is automatically converted
back into a text file for them to open and look at. Finally, they are each sent
3 text messages, one to inform them the timecard has been sent, one to inform
them of the scheduled direct deposit date, and a final one to refer them back to
me if they see any errors on their timecard or have any questions.


Technologies:
	* bash
	* java

Dependencies:
	* xlsx2csv (convert the excel spreadsheet to a csv)
	* java jre (parse the csv and generate the timeCard)
   	* ssmtp (send the emails/texts)

To run:
	./SendTimeCards.sh
