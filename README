Payroll Time Card Generator

Author: Taylor Poulsen
Date: January 2021

This program takes a specifically formatted excel spreadsheet and converts
it into a csv to then be parsed and generate a timecard textfile. This text
file will then be parsed again to broken up into messages of 160 characters
or less (text message rules) and then automatically sent to the appropriate
recipients.
